HR Data Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of HR data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to explore employee attrition, performance, demographics, and salary trends to help organizations make data-driven workforce decisions. By analyzing employee behavior and identifying factors that influence turnover and performance, this project delivers actionable insights for optimizing workforce management and retention strategies.

The dataset contains employee-level information, including unique employee identifiers, age, gender, department, job role, education, attrition status, monthly income, performance rating, years at the company, and overtime status. This information allows for a detailed understanding of employee demographics, job distributions, compensation patterns, and performance trends.

The analysis covers several aspects of HR data, such as demographic distribution (age, gender, education), department and role distributions, salary trends, attrition factors, the relationship between tenure and attrition, the impact of overtime on retention, performance ratings across departments, and correlation analysis to identify key drivers of attrition. Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn help in interpreting the data, while optional predictive modeling with Scikit-learn can further explore factors influencing employee turnover.

To run the project, first clone the repository and open the notebook Hr_data_analyse.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code. Required Python libraries include Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and optionally Scikit-learn. Step-by-step execution of the notebook reproduces the analysis and visualizations, making it easy to explore insights independently.

Some example insights from the analysis include higher attrition rates among employees with less than two years of service, a strong correlation between overtime and attrition, high headcount and turnover in the R&D department, and relatively consistent performance ratings across departments. For larger datasets, integrating SQL or cloud-based databases can improve performance.
